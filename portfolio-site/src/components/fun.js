            <ul>
                <li>I am an avid creative writer. I've been published in my university's literary journal several times. I'm almost always working on a new story.</li>
                <li>Whilst still a novice, I enjoy analog photography. I am currently putting together a zine of photographs that showcase the culture and liveliness my city, Albuquerque.</li>
                <li>I am a multi-media artist! I paint and do pottery!</li>
                <li>As cliche as it sounds, I do love to code. If I'm not working on a project, I'm reading through the documentation for a library or tool. I am currently working on a JRPG style videogame with my friends. It's a step away from web development but I've enjoyed sharpening my C# for it. 
                </li>
                <li>I love the outdoors! On weekends you can find me hiking or backpacking a local trail and then heading to a craft brewery in the afternoon. Nothing inspires me quite like being out in nature.</li>
            </ul>
